FTB Sky Odyssey was initially meant to be a simple expansion to FTB sky Adventures. The intention was to add a few new quests which would provide the pack with some end game targets for players to aim for. To begin with we expanded the pack by adding several extra mods, with the goal of adding a more OP feel to it, drawing inspiration from what was the recently released Stoneblock modpack.

During the early development of the design phase it quickly became clear that in order to reach the goals that we wanted to achieve,  a small update was no longer going to really be adequate. We looked at several concepts that were first introduced in the Sky Adventures modpack and took the decision to expand on them greatly. With this, we moved away from an expansion to Sky Adventures, and into a completely new modpack.
