We have added a brand new powerful loot crate system which can be found by killing various hostile and passive mobs. Inside you may find powerful new items to help you on your journey or you may find a stick. Loot crates come in several different varieties.

This is accompanied by 2 new blocks. Firstly the Loot Crate Storage block which can be used to store massive amounts of loot crates easily. This is accompanied by the Loot Crate Opener which can be used to automate the opening of loot crates.
