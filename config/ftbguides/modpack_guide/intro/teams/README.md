FTB Sky Odyssey multiplayer allows you to play the pack using the FTB Utilities 'Teams' function. This can be accessed from the main inventory screen using the teams icon in the top left corner.

Opening this interface will allow you to either create a new team or join an existing team. Once you have joined a team, you will then be given the option of which type of island start you want to begin on.

Whilst you are part of a team, certain quests may be flagged as team quests, which means that each team can only complete those quests once. With EMC each individual will carry their own EMC total. With regards to the beast coin miner, the person who places the block is the person who will receive the coins that miner generates. However if you want to transfer some of your money to a team member you can do so using the /pay command.
