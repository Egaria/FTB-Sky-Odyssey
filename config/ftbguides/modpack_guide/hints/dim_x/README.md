The ultimate goal of this pack is to escape the confines of the Skyblock World that you have spawned in. You can achieve this by opening a portal to Dimension X and stepping through the portal.

In order to open the portal you will first need to craft 12 portal frames. These should be placed on the ground in a 5x5 circle (with the corners missing). You will then need to collect the 12 trophies from the Finale quest line. Placing 1 of each of the trophies onto the portal frames will open up the gateway to Dimension X allowing you to escape.
