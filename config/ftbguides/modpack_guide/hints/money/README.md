One of the core mechanics of FTB Sky Odyssey is the ability to buy items that will help you on your journey from the in game shop. This pack contains a variety of ways to earn currency. Firstly and most importantly you can complete quests. Most quests in the pack offer some form of random coin reward which can be used to help get you started. In addition to this you will also find a page dedicated to repeatable quests. These are all fluid quests that can be submitted via a Task Screen and can be repeated to generate more income. Finally we have added a custom new block that can be powered using RF. This block will generate currency over time, however each time you 'mine' a coin the next coin will get a bit more expensive than the last.
